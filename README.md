V2EX iOS Client
========

The iOS client for V2EX.

## What is V2EX?
> V2EX is a community of start-ups, designers, developers and creative people.

It is created by [@Livid](https://github.com/livid). We all appreciate that he contributes a lot for it.

## Swift Work!
Now I'm working on creating a new repo using the wonderful Swift!

## How to start?
This project is using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).  
You have to execute `pod install` and use `V2EX.xcworkspace`.  
At present time, CocoaPods hasn't support Swift library yet. So we use *git submodule* to support Swift libraries such as [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick). You have to execute `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull these libraries.  

## TODOs
You could find all the TODOs right here: https://github.com/imWildCat/V2EX-iOS/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open (Issues labelled enhancement).
